# triplet-bmu

Reads Battery data such as the cumulated charged Ah from the BMU of Mitsubishi I-Miev, Citroen C-Zero and Peugeot Ion with an OBDLink SX, MX or LX and saves it as a .csv file

It was indended to run on Windows but should work on other platforms with minimal modification.

If you use the MX or LX you should choose the outgoing virtual serial port that is created after pairing.
To permanently save the port you need to edit the file config.ini that is created after the initial launch.
